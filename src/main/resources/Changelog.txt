 5.0 - Complete rewrite. Everything rewritten from the ground up. No more public statics or arbitrary textures. Gone with the spaghetti code that stayed for 3 years.

     - CNG: The message sender will now show up on the chat instead of requiring the user to hover your mouse over.
     - CNG: UI overhaul. The language select screen is one thing that bothered me the most. It's too large and it's clunky to use.
     - RMV: Manual translate. Originally it is supposed to let you request a translation again through a chat log, but it is pretty useless and don't work most of the time.
     - RMV: Help screen. Replaced with tooltips
     - RMV: Logging level. This thing is pretty much useless
